          Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed by CD Projekt Red and published by CD Projekt. Set in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk universe, players assume the role of a customisable mercenary
          known as V, who can acquire skills in hacking and machinery with options for melee and ranged combat. The main story follows V's struggle as he deals with a mysterious cybernetic implant that threatens to overwrite his body with
          the personality and memories of a deceased celebrity only perceived by V; the two must work together to be separated and save V's life.

          The game's development began following the release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Blood and Wine (2016). The game was developed by a team of around 500 people using the REDengine 4 game engine. CD Projekt launched a new division in
          Wrocław, Poland, and partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia, QLOC, and Jali Research to aid the production. Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith was a consultant, and actor Keanu Reeves has a starring role. The original score was led
          by Marcin Przybyłowicz, featuring the contributions of several licensed artists.

          After years of anticipation, CD Projekt released Cyberpunk 2077 for PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows, and Xbox One on 10 December 2020, followed by PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 15 February 2022. It received praise from
          critics for its narrative, setting, and graphics, although some of its gameplay elements received mixed responses, while its themes and representation of transgender characters received some criticism. It was also widely
          criticized for bugs, particularly in the console versions, which suffered from performance problems; Sony removed it from the PlayStation Store from December 2020 to June 2021 while CD Projekt rectified some of the problems. CD
          Projekt became subject to investigations and class-action lawsuits for their perceived attempts at downplaying the severity of the technical problems before release; these were ultimately cleared with a settlement of US$1.85
          million. By April 2022, the game had sold more than 18 million copies. An expansion, Phantom Liberty, is set to release in 2023 on PC and ninth generation of video game consoles. A sequel is in development.
